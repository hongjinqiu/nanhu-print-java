# What is nanhu-print-java

nanhu-print-java is a pdf generation framework implemented in java language. 

Users can configure a file in xml format and prepare the json data format they want to print.

Then call the nanhu-print-java framework API to complete the generation of a PDF file.

nanhu-print-java can help users complete these functions that are common in enterprise applications and difficult to achieve with direct code programming by configuring xml:

- Each page has a fixed header, and the last page has a fixed footer.
- Display the page number anywhere on each page.
- Print with template(use an image as background)
- Watermark
- Alternate printing of different backgrounds in the table rows

Cooperating with the nanhu-print-js framework on the web front end, the pdf printing format can be customized.
